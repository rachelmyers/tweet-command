Tweet Command is a shell script that shortens urls with bit.ly and opens a browser window to Twitter with the short url in a New Tweet field.  It uses some native short urls and assumes that you are already logged in to Twitter. It also requires the base58 gem; if you don't have it already, enter 'gem install base58' on the command line to install it. (A common way to shorten urls is to convert them to a base-58 string, and this gem handles the conversion.)

It came about because I can't do the math in my head to shorten a flickr url.  

To install, 

1. Download using the download button. 
2. Copy it into your $PATH.  

To be more specific, if you have a /usr/local/bin folder, 
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

Or, if you don't have a /usr/local/bin folder and want one:
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

You should now be able to open a terminal window, enter the command "tweet (longform URL)" and watch as a new browser window opens with the shortened URL ready to be tweeted.

The first time you run Tweet Command, you'll be prompted to provide a bit.ly login and API key.  To find your API key, go to bit.ly, make an account if you don't have one, sign in and navigate to user settings.

Troubleshooting:
If you screw up entering your bit.ly credentials, Tweet Command won't work.  If this happens, remove the file that stores your credentials:

rm ~/.bitly

and try again.
