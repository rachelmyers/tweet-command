Tweet Command is a shell script that shortens urls and opens a browser window to twitter with the short url.  It uses some native short urls.

It came about because I can't do the math in my head to shorten a flickr url.  

To install, 

1. Download using the download button. 
2. Copy it into your $PATH.  

To be more specific, if you have a /usr/local/bin folder, 
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

Or, if you don't have a /usr/local/bin folder and want one:
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

To use Tweet Command, in a terminal window, use the command "tweet" and paste in the url to shorten.

The first time you use it, you'll be prompted to provide a bit.ly login and API key.  To find your API key, go to bit.ly, make an account if you don't have one, sign in and navigate to user settings.

Troubleshooting:
If you screw up entering your bit.ly credentials, Tweet Command won't work.  If this happens, remove the file that stores your credentials:

rm ~/.bitly

And try again.
