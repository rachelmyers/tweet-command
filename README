Tweet Command is a shell script that shortens urls and opens a browser window to twitter with the short url.  It uses some native short urls.

It came about because I can't do the math in my head to shorten a flickr url.  

To install, 

1. Download using the download button. 
2. Copy it into your $PATH.  

To be more specific, if you have a /usr/local/bin folder, 
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

Or, if you don't have a /usr/local/bin folder and want one:
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
sudo cp ~/Downloads/tweet_command/tweet /usr/local/bin

To use Tweet Command, in a terminal window, use the command "tweet" and paste in the url to shorten.

The first time you use it, two things will happen that will never happen again.  First, if you don't have base 58 gem, you'll be prompted to install it.  (A common way to shorten urls is to convert them to a base-58 string, and this gem handles the conversion.)  Second, you'll be prompted to provide a bit.ly login and API key.  To find your API key, go to bit.ly, make an account if you don't have one, sign in and navigate to user settings.

Troubleshooting:
If you screw up entering your bit.ly credentials, Tweet Command won't work.  If this happens, remove the file that stores your credentials:

rm ~/.bitly

And try again.
